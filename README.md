## About me
I have been studying as a software developer for the past 3 years. Throughout this time, I have acquired a wide range of skills, with my strongest expertise lying in Java and Jetpack Compose.
Additionally, driven by my passion for video games I have also started studying Unity and Godot.

Although I still need to complete my internship, I think I am ready for employment. Therefore, I am currently seeking new opportunities in software development.

## Current activities
I am currently expanding my knowlodge by doing online courses and personal projects.
